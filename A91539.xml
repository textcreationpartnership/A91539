            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO put it out of diſpute that our paſsions are made uſe of by our enemies, and that we have motives often by corrupt perſons ſuggeſted for them to their advantage, I have encloſed this Letter which was caſually dropt by the Cardinall in paſſing from his Coach to the Louvre, it being my fortune to be that night at Court; and unobſerved, to take it up.</p>
            <p>Sir, I ſubmit it to your judgement, either to conceale, or communicate it, and reſt,</p>

            <p>THe obligations and many inſtances of affection which I have received from your Eminence, doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to make returns ſuitable and commenſurat to your merits; but although I have this ſet home upon my ſpirit, yet I may not (ſhall I tell you I cannot) at this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118765:2"/>juncture of time, and as the face of my affaires now ſtands, anſwer to your Call for Toleration; I ſay, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not as to a publique declaration of my ſenſe in that point; although I believe that under my Government your Eminence in the behalf of Catholiques has leſſe reaſon for complaint, as to rigour upon mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then under the Parliament; For I have of ſome, and thoſe very many had compaſſion, making a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Truly I have, and I may ſpeak it with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the preſence of God who is a witneſſe within me to that truth I affirm, made a difference, and as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks, pluckt many out of the fire, the raging fire of perſecution, which did tyrannize over their conſciences, and encroacht by arbitrarineſſe of power upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: And herein it is my purpoſe, as ſoone as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move impediments, and ſome weights that preſſe me down, to make a further progreſſe, and to diſcharge my promiſe to your Eminence in relation to that.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhal come to return your Eminence thanks for your judicious choice of that perſon to whom you have entruſted our weightieſt affaire, an affaire wherein your Eminence is concerned, though not in equall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meaſures with my ſelf. I muſt confeſſe that I had ſome doubts of its ſucceſſe, till Providence clear'd them to me by the effects. I was not truly and to ſpeak ingenuouſly without doubtings, and ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to give your Eminence the grounds I had for ſuch doubtings; I did feare that <hi>Barkley</hi> would not have been able to goe through and carry on that work, if either the Duke had cool'd in his ſuit, or condeſcended to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I doubted alſo that thoſe inſtructions which I ſent over by 290 were not cleare enough as to expreſſion;

            <p>If I am not miſtaken, greatly miſtaken in his character as I received it from your Eminence, that fire which is kindled between them now wil not ask bellows to blow it, and to keep it burning; but what I think further ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this matter I will ſend your Eminence by <hi>Lockart:</hi> and now I ſhall boaſt to your Eminence my Security, upon a well-builded confidence in the Lord; for I diſtruſt not but if this breach be widened a little more, and this difference fomented with ſome caution in reſpect of the perſons to be added to it; I diſtruſt not but that party which is already forſaken of God (as to any outward diſpenſations of mercies) and noyſome to their Countrymen, will grow lower in the opinions of all the world.</p>
            <p>If I have troubled your Eminence too long in this, you may impute it to the reſentment of joy which I have for the iſſue of this affayre, and will conclude with giving you aſſurance that I will never be backward in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating as becomes your Brother and Confederate, that I am</p>
